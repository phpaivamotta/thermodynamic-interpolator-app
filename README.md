# thermodynamic-interpolator-app

GUI app that Interpolates thermodynamic values from several tables.

This app was built using the libraries:
* Tkinter
* Pandas
* Scipy

This was my first ever Python project! I was determined to learn Python during winter break before my classes began,
so I had the idea of putting the Python tutorials I was watching to practice by building a GUI app that would interpolate
all values from several thermodynamic tables for me.

Where were these tables from and why did I need to use them in the first place?

Well, I took thermodynamics for one of my college classes and MOST of our time during homework was spent interpolating the damn values!
After you found the values, it was just plug and chug, but it was hell finding the values in the first place!

This frustrated me to such an extent that I spent a good chunk of my break copying and pasting the values from my thermodynamics book and building this 
app so that my colleagues and I would never have to go through this again. 

Finally, I got it done. Drum roll... :drum::drum::drum:Tada!

There are four input fields in the app:
* Table
* Parameter type
* Pressure
* Parameter value

The table is where it all starts. Have a look at the Thermo Tables Python.xlsx file in this repository to have a better understanding of the tables being used.
There are all sorts of thermodynamic parameters AND TABLES! Can you imagine having to go through all of them during a test, when your adrenaline is pumping? 
Yeah, it was awful. This is why this app came in handy.

With this app, you can just put in the values you want and the app will spit out all interpolated values for a table!

Go ahead, give it a try! Just download the script and excel file, put them in a separate folder, and run it in your IDE. The GUI will pop-up and you can play around with it! 

And don't worry about breaking it with your input, they are all validated.
